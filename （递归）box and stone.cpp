/*Description

Suppose there are M boxes and N stones, and M <= N, please write a program to compute the number of ways to put those N stones to M boxes. Each box can be empty. You can think that all stones are the same and all boxes are the same.

Input Format

Multiple test cases will be tested. Each test case contains only one line with two integers M and N(1 <= M <= N <= 10). The first line contains the test case count.

Output Format

Output the number of ways to put those N stones to M boxes. The result will not exceed 2 ^31 - 1.

Sample Input
    1
    3 7

Sample Output
    8

Explanation of the sample output:
	(0, 0, 7)
	(0, 1, 6)
	(0, 2, 5)
	(0, 3, 4)
	(1, 1, 5)
	(1, 2, 4)
	(1, 3, 3)
	(2, 2, 3)*/
